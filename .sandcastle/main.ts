// and deploys it to the shared docs-preview alias for a live preview URL.
// Run this with: npm run sandcastle  (alias for: npx tsx .sandcastle/main.ts)

  // doesn't exist in the container — so pnpm treats it as incompatible and tries
  // to purge+reinstall, which aborts non-interactively
  // (ERR_PNPM_ABORTED_REMOVE_MODULES_DIR_NO_TTY). A clean install in the container
  // is correct; the cold-install cost can be optimised later (e.g. a warm pnpm
  // store baked into the image or a persistent store volume).
